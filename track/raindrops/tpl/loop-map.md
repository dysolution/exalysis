- Using a map is a perfectly natural idea in this kind of situation. However, be careful: because maps are implemented as hash tables, the order of their keys is not guaranteed. In fact, when you iterate over the keys of a map, you will get them in a different, random order each time. So in this situation, a map is not the right choice (try a slice instead). See the `Iteration order` section of this article for more information: [Go maps in action](https://blog.golang.org/go-maps-in-action).
