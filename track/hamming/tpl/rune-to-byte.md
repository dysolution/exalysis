- You are converting a rune to a byte. Go runes can consist of multiple bytes, so this conversion can cause you problems if you have to deal with non-ASCII characters. However, in this case it's OK, because the input string contains only ASCII (single-byte) characters.

    To get a deeper understanding of these issues you might like to read [Strings, bytes, runes and characters in Go](https://blog.golang.org/strings) on the Go blog.
