- A loop approach to calculating `SquareOfSum` works, but there's a short-cut. The great mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss faced the same problem as you when he was at school in the 1700s: to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100. The question was assigned as busywork by the teacher, but Gauss found the answer rather quickly by discovering a pattern. Can you find it too? (Unlike Gauss, you can use the Internet to search for answers!)
