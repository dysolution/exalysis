- To create a floating point value you can use the literal `2.0`, instead of a type conversion `float64(2)`. If it is clear to Go that you are trying to create a float then `2` is enough. When does Go know you want a float? For example, if you use it as a parameter in a function call that expects a `float` or if you assign it to a variable of type `float`.
