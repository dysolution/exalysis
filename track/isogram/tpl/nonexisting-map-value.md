- Did you know that a map in Go never panics if you ask it for a nonexistent key? Instead it returns the [zero value](https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value) for that type. For example, if you have a `map[X]bool` it will return `false` if the entry does not exist. So you can query the `map` without using the `value, ok` syntax: `if somemap[somekey] {...}`.
