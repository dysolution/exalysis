- Go has a very active user community, and there are lots of ways for you to be part of it! There's the [`golang-nuts` mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/golang-nuts), a [Go Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/), a [Gophers Slack organization](https://invite.slack.golangbridge.org/), a [Go discussion forum](https://forum.golangbridge.org/), and hundreds of [Go meetups](https://go-meetups.appspot.com/). Why not find one in your local area and give it a try? Gophers are very friendly people!
